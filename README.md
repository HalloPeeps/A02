Github tutorial!!!! :D

1) Make a GitHub account by connecting your email. 
2) On the dashboard click "New" in the top left.
3) Give the repository a name and status. (Public/Private) (adding a README file is optional)
4) Click "Create Repository" to have it on the account.
5) Download and open Webstorm.
6) Click "Get from VCS". 
7) Webstorm has a neat feature that allows you to log into Github on the application.
8) If logged in, click on "GitHub" and the repositories should be right there.
9) Otherwise, click on "Repository URL" and paste the repository location into the bar.
10) Click on "Clone" which would open a new window allowing you to create and modify files.
11) Happy Coding! (Make sure to commit the changes and make backups!)


Definitions:
**Branch**
Researched definition: a separate, independent version of the main codebase that allows developers to work on a project without affecting the main.
My definition: A seperate portion of the main used to develop different features separately, test code, and undo changes without directly making changes to the main.

**Clone**
Researched definition: the process of copying an existing repository to a new location, either on the local machine or on a remote server.
My definition: a copy and paste of an existing item. mainly used when creating backups, troubleshoot testing, adding, or modifying existing content.

**Commit**
Researched definition: a snapshot of a project's state at a specific point in time.
My definition: an individual save of a changed file.

**Fetch** 
Researched definition: downloads files, commits, and references from a remote repository into a local repository without merging them into the working directory.
My definition: a command to download contents from a repository.

**GIT**
Researched definition: a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that helps software development teams track changes to their code.
My definition: A system that saves and keeps track of code.

**Github** 
Researched definition: a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.
My definition: a place where developers collaborate, coordinate, track, and update their work.

**Merge** 
Researched definition: Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.
My definition: command that lets you take the lines created by multiple branches and integrate them into one branch.

**Merge Conflict**
Researched definition: when two or more branches have changes that Git cannot automatically merge.
My definition: when merging code clashes with other's edits. (one person is editing code that is being merged by another person, one branch is deleted while someone is editing it, etc)

**Push**
Researched definition: command used to upload local repository content to a remote repository
My definition: way to transfer commits from your local to the remote repository.

**Pull** 
Researched definition: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
My definition: downloads from the repository and then merged with the remote content into a new local merge commit. 

**Remote**
Researched definition: a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.
My definition: a repository that is held on the internet or an off-site server that isnt local.

**Repository** 
Researched definition: a collections of files from various versions of a Project
My definition: Where the code and files are stored
